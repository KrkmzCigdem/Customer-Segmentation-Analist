# Customer-Segmentation-Analist

## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using the MallCustomer.csv dataset. By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and clustering models, we group customers into distinct segments to support targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer service.

## 📊 Dataset
The MallCustomer.csv dataset contains the following customer attributes:
1) CustomerID
2) Gender
3) Age
4) Annual Income (k$)
5) Spending Score (1-100)
